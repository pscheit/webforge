# Setup

Setup is the namespace for configuration / installer and environment related settings.

## ConfigurationTester
The ConfigurationTester is able to check configuration of the environment (currently PHP-ini values) to a set of fixed values. The php.ini settings can be received through the ConfigurationRetriever (for example from a apache dump-script).
