# Framework

Framework is the namespace for classes that manage the way webforge interacts with its classes and objects to itself and to other libraries.
Framework refers here to structures that help to build up the "whole picture".

## Psc CMS Bridge

For legacy code this bridges a webforge package with the (old) Psc CMS Project.
The bootstrapping process changed in webforge and the project is not exactly what is needed for a good boilerplate. The package should replace the project in all places were possible.
